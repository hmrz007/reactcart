api call in js
==============
AJAX-asynchronous
javascript and xml

-XMLhttp
-fetch
-async await


-useEffect used instead of ngOnInit 


redirection in react
====================
react-router-dom  ()     (npm install react-router-dom)

import { BrowserRouter=all routing need components
Routes=to set paths for each component
Route =more than 1path
} from 'react-router-dom';


useParams -hook used to access params from component url

REDUX
------

coupling-many connection between parent and child componentprops
props drilling -in coupling if any intermediate component have any errors all other childs will not work 

to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the components independant

for this react intoduced a new technology - state management technology-REDUX



redux process
=============
create a new js file to keep the states,all the components can access the js file

-the components can access the datas from the js file
but the cant update datas in js file

-action     -a file where all the logics to update the state
-dispatch   -method used to dispatch he logic in action file when the component need state  updation
-reducer    - update the datas in js file according to the payload response get action file


libraries to apply redux
========================
1-REDUX
2-REACT REDUX
3-REDUX-THUNK

        npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk 

createStore()   -method in REDUX used to create store in js file
                -2 args
                -1-reducer
                -2-middleware (used to make synchronous redux into asynchronous)

applyMiddleware() - method in REDUX to apply middleware

combineReducers()   -method in REDUX used to combine all the reducers in js file


thunk -in REDUX-THUNK used to create middleware

1.create store 
2.apply the store in index.js  

    provider-   its a tag used to pass the store  (react-redux)
